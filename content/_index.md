### About

Hi there!

Im currently working as FX TD and created this page to document and share workflows, ideas and notes about various vfx topics as well as my recent deep learning adventures. The quality of the notes may vary greatly and there is no garantuee for correctness.

Hit me up if you find any mistakes or know of better ways to do certain things.

I hope you find the notes useful!

Best,

Jakob
