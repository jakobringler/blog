- drop down a `Movie File Out` TOP and choose image sequence
- you can set the `N` parameter to `me.time.frame`
- the filename already has a `me.fileSuffix`: very useful! leave it
- set TouchDesigner to non-Realtime mode by toggling off the Realtime Button at the top of the screen (this avoids dropping any frames)
- go to the beginning of your timeline
- turn on `Record` on the Movie File Out TOP and hit play
