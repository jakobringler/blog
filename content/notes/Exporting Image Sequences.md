- set your timeline in and out options to the desired length
- drop down a `Movie File Out` TOP and choose image sequence
- put the following snippet as an expression in the file path 
``` Python
'myImgSeq' + me.fileSuffix.replace( str(tdu.digits( me.fileSuffix )), f"{tdu.digits( me.fileSuffix ):04}")
```
- to also export audio reference the audio CHOP in the related parameter
- set TouchDesigner to non-Realtime mode by toggling off the Realtime Button at the top of the screen (this avoids dropping any frames)
- set the loop option to `once`
- go to the beginning of your timeline
- turn on `Record` on the Movie File Out TOP and hit play
