For [[notes/Back Propagation|Back Propagation]] I asked chatGPT to explain it in houdini terms and it turned out surprisingly great so here is the GPT spin on "Gradient Descent x Houdini":

### Gradient Descent and Erosion in Houdini

1. **What is Gradient Descent?**  
    Gradient descent is like a hiker trying to find the lowest point in a valley. The hiker starts at a random spot and takes small steps downhill, adjusting their path based on the steepness of the slope. In machine learning, this process helps optimize a model by minimizing the error.
    
2. **Erosion as a Visual Parallel**:  
    Think of erosion in Houdini as a similar process. When you apply erosion to a terrain, you’re simulating how water or wind gradually carves away at the landscape. Just like the hiker, the terrain is shaped by the “gradient” of the surface—where it’s steep, that’s where the most material gets worn away.
    
3. **Step-by-Step Adjustments**:  
    In gradient descent, the algorithm takes small steps based on the calculated gradient (the slope) of the loss function. The size of that step is called learning rate. Similarly, when simulating erosion  in Houdini, you can control the intensity and scale of the erosion effect. This determines how much material will be moved in each simulation frame.
