The following is a compilation of all sorts of handy houdini tips & tricks that were shared in the #today-i-learned channel on the [Think Procedural Discord Server](https://thinkprocedural.com/). Over time I will add here what I find useful. 
Do yourself a favour and check it out an scroll to the top of the thread to find some hidden secrets!

## Quality of Life

### Network 
- Pressing `8` in the network view toggles wire auto connection on and off (very handy if you move nodes around and don't want to mess up your setups)
- Drag a wire in the middle of an unconnected node to instantly wire up in- **and** output
- Drag & drop a camera node in the viewport to look through that camera
- You can save geometry of any node through the right click menu

### Viewport
- `Ctrl` or `Shift` + `Arrow Keys` let's you rotate / move views
- `M` enables first person movement with `WASD`, `Shift` to sprint, `Ctrl` to slowdown and `Q` / `E` to lift / descend
