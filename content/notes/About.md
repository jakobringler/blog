Hi there!

Im currently working as an FX TD and created this page to document and share workflows, ideas and notes about houdini and various other vfx topics as well as my recent deep learning adventures. 

This is by no means a documentation or manual, but much more a digital personal notebook. That's why it's rather unstructured at times and also contains different summaries of already existing resources and tutorials. I try my best to link to any sources. The quality of the notes may vary greatly and there is no garantuee for correctness.

[Hit me up](https://twitter.com/jakobrin) if you find any mistakes or know of better ways to do things.

I hope you find something useful!

Best,

Jakob
