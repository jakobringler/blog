## Back Propagation

I also asked chatGPT to explain back prop and make some houdini analogies and it's surprisingly useful. So if the above was still a bit too technical this might help you connect some concepts in your mind.

### Backpropagation in Houdini Terms

1. **Forward Pass – Setting Up Your Sim**:
   Think of the forward pass like when you’re setting up a simulation in Houdini. You’ve got your nodes, parameters, and settings all lined up. You hit play and let the magic happen, kind of like how a neural network processes input data to spit out a prediction.

2. **Calculate Error – Checking the Result**:
   Once you’ve run the sim, you render it to see how it turned out. Maybe you’re going for an epic explosion, and when you check the result, it just doesn’t pop like you wanted. That feeling of disappointment? That’s your “error” telling you something’s off.

3. **Backward Pass – Figuring Out What Went Wrong**:
   Now, you have to play detective. Backpropagation is like tracing back through your nodes to see where you went wrong. If that explosion is lacking some oomph, you’ll dive into the nodes that control forces or sources to see what needs tweaking—just like how a neural network looks back to adjust weights based on what caused the error.

4. **Update Weights – Tuning Your Settings**:
   Time to fix things up! You might crank up the forces or adjust the particle lifespan. This is similar to how you update weights in a neural network to improve accuracy. In Houdini, you’re making those little adjustments to get closer to the look you want, based on what you learned from the last render and what you can see in your reference.

So, backpropagation in machine learning is a lot like tweaking your Houdini setups: you start with a cool idea, check how it turned out, dig into what needs fixing, and then make those adjustments to get closer to your vision or reference. It’s all about learning and improving with each iteration!
