( For simplicities sake we will go forward with vanilla [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). )\n\n```bash\nconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch\n```\n\nAs [jpparkeramnh](https://www.sidefx.com/profile/jpparkeramnh/) pointed out in [this](https://www.sidefx.com/forum/topic/58397/) SideFX forum post you have to export the **LD_PRELOAD** variable.\n\n```bash\nexport LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libpython3.7m.so\n```\n\nI also recommend sourcing Houdini in the terminal.\n\nTo do so first open the .bashrc in the terminal\n\n```bash\nnano .bashrc\n```\n\nand add the following lines to your .bashrc\n\n```bash\ncd /opt/hfs19.0/\nsource ./houdini_setup\ncd ~\nconda activate hou\nexport LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libpython3.7m.so\nalias expenv='LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libpython3.7m.so'\n```\n\n-   The first 3 lines run the houdini setup bash script\n-   Line 4 activates a default environment ( for me “hou” )\n-   Line 5 exports the LD_PRELOAD varible of the currently activated environment ( hou )\n-   Line 6 creates an alias to export the currently activated environment from the terminal\n\nNow you should be able to just activate your respecitve conda environment, export the correct LD_PRELOAD variable by typing “**expenv**” and then run houdini from there by typing “**houdini**“.\n\nTo check if everything is running as expected open the Houdini Python shell and type:\n\n```python\nimport torch \n```\n\nIf it doesn’t give you any errors you should be good to go.\n\n\nRelated: [[notes/Houdini |Houdini]], [[notes/Deep Learning |Deep Learning]]","lastmodified":"2022-05-09T21:35:08.897285532Z","tags":null},"/notes/Tensors":{"title":"Tensors","content":"\n# What are \"Tensors\"?\n![[notes/images/tensordims.png]]\n# Image Tensors\n![[notes/images/imagetensor.png]]","lastmodified":"2022-05-09T21:35:08.897285532Z","tags":null}}
