Usually this shape will be some n-dimensional [[notes/Tensors |Tensor]]. \n\nWhen working with 2D image data the files are read from disk. There are tons of tools and functions in most of the DL Frameworks that convert all sorts of files to correctly shaped tensors. In Houdini however, the data at hand is most likely not in a format (.jpg .png etc.) that can be extracted easily by a premade data loading solution.\n\nTo extract the data somewhat _liveish_ without having to write anything to disk and read it back in another step, a function that reads directly from houdini geometry is more efficient.\n\nThis brings us to the main issue: Where to store the data?\n\nUnfortunately storing image data on 3D geometry isn't very efficient. Polygon grids also store connectivity information and other data which make them rather slow to work with, especially when dealing with higher resolutions. \n\nTested when trying to do [[notes/Digit Recognition in Houdini |Digit Recognition in Houdini]].\n\n### The Solution:\n\n**Heightfields** or '2D-Volumes' (weird name). \n\nThey have a grid-like topology and only store a single value per voxel instead of unnecessary connectivity information or other data. \n\nHoudini also ships with a python function to extract voxel data quickly, which allows us to convert the 2D information into the necessary shape.\n\n```Python \n# this goes in a Python SOP\n\nimport hou\nimport numpy as np\n\nnode = hou.pwd()\ngeo = node.geometry()\n\nW = 128 # image width\nH = W   # image height\n\ncanvas = geo.prim(0) # reads the 0th primitive \n\ncanvasVoxels = canvas.allVoxels() # reads all voxel values as one big array [1, 2, ... , n]\n\ninput = np.asarray(canvasVoxels, dtype=np.float64)\ninput = input.reshape(W,H) # creates a tensor of shape [128,128,1]\n```\n\nSee [[notes/Towers From Sketch |Towers From Sketch]] to find out more about the applications of this technique.\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-03T21:39:51.472613615Z","tags":null},"/notes/Back-Propagation":{"title":"Back Propagation","content":"\n# Back Propagation\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-03T21:39:51.472613615Z","tags":null},"/notes/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs":{"title":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)","content":"\n### Architecture:\n\n### Kernels:\n\n\n![[notes/images/convkernel2CC.png]]\n\n![[notes/images/convkernel_2 1.png]]\n\nRelated: [[notes/Feed Forward Networks (FFNs) |Feed Forward Networks (FFNs)]], [[notes/Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) |Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)]], [[notes/Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) |Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)]] \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-03T21:39:51.472613615Z","tags":null},"/notes/Deep-Learning":{"title":"Deep Learning","content":"\n### ML Basics for Technical 3D Artists / TDs:\n##### Concepts:\n- [[notes/Tensors |Tensors]]\n- [[notes/Gradient Descent |Gradient Descent]]\n- [[notes/Back Propagation |Back Propagation]]\n\n##### Model Archtiectures\n- [[notes/Feed Forward Networks (FFNs) |Feed Forward Networks (FFNs)]]\n- [[notes/Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) |Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)]]\n- [[notes/Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) |Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)]]\n- [[notes/Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) |Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)]]\n\n##### Data\n- Data Synthesis\n- Data Augmentation\n- Noise\n\n##### Realistic Applications\n- Compress Algorithms\n- Increase Usabiliy \u0026 Accessability\n\n### Setup Guides:\n-  [[notes/Setting up Anaconda and Houdini for 3D Deep Learning on Linux |Setting up Anaconda and Houdini for 3D Deep Learning on Linux]]\n\n### Houdini DL \"Hacks\":\n- [[notes/Abusing Heightfields as Fast Image Canvas |Abusing Heightfields as Fast Image Canvas]]\n\n### Projects \u0026 Examples:\n- [[notes/Digit Recognition in Houdini |Digit Recognition in Houdini]]\n- Sketch to Tower\n- Vegetation \u0026 Erosion\n- Wave Function Collapse Prediction\n- Neural Cellular Automata","lastmodified":"2022-06-03T21:39:51.472613615Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digit-Recognition-in-Houdini":{"title":"Digit Recognition in Houdini","content":"\n![[notes/images/digitRec_Banner.gif]]\n\nthe files can be found here: [GitHub -

( For simplicities sake we will go forward with vanilla [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). )\n\n```bash\nconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch\n```\n\nAs [jpparkeramnh](https://www.sidefx.com/profile/jpparkeramnh/) pointed out in [this](https://www.sidefx.com/forum/topic/58397/) SideFX forum post you have to export the **LD_PRELOAD** variable.\n\n```bash\nexport LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libpython3.7m.so\n```\n\n### .bashrc Modifications:\n\nI also recommend sourcing Houdini in the terminal.\n\nTo do so first open the .bashrc in the terminal\n\n```bash\nnano .bashrc\n```\n\nand add the following lines to your .bashrc\n\n```bash\ncd /opt/hfs19.0/\nsource ./houdini_setup\ncd ~\nconda activate hou\nexport LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libpython3.7m.so\nalias expenv='LD_PRELOAD=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/libpython3.7m.so'\n```\n\n-   The first 3 lines run the houdini setup bash script\n-   Line 4 activates a default environment ( for me “hou” )\n-   Line 5 exports the LD_PRELOAD varible of the currently activated environment ( hou )\n-   Line 6 creates an alias to export the currently activated environment from the terminal\n\nNow you should be able to just activate your respecitve conda environment, export the correct LD_PRELOAD variable by typing “**expenv**” and then run houdini from there by typing “**houdini**“.\n\nTo check if everything is running as expected open the Houdini Python shell and type:\n\n```python\nimport torch \n```\n\nIf it doesn’t give you any errors you should be good to go.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-03T21:39:51.472613615Z","tags":null},"/notes/Tensors":{"title":"Tensors","content":"\n### What are \"Tensors\"?\n\n\n![[notes/images/tensordims.png]]\n\n### Image Tensors:\n![[notes/images/imagetensor.png]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-03T21:39:51.472613615Z","tags":null},"/notes/VEX-Snippets":{"title":"VEX Snippets","content":"\n# Wrangle Cheat Sheet\n\u003eI try my best to credit and link to any sources.
